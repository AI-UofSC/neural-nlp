# Setup

## Installation
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate neural-nlp
```

## Retrieve models and stimuli
```bash
cd ressources
./setup.sh
cd ..
```
This script will run all `setup.sh` files for all models and all stimuli.

You can also run only a part of the setup files if you don't need all the ressources.
